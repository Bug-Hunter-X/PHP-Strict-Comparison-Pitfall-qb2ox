# PHP Strict Comparison Bug
This repository demonstrates a common error in PHP related to strict comparison (===) and how to solve it.

The `bug.php` file shows the buggy code, while `bugSolution.php` provides the corrected version.  The issue arises from the unintended use of strict comparison, resulting in incorrect evaluations when comparing values of different types but equal value. The solution involves switching to loose comparison (==) in appropriate situations to ensure proper results.
